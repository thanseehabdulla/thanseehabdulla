### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Abdulla, I live in Kerala, Kasaragod India and I work as a Staff Software Engineer at IBM Labs where we're building digital solution products for our clients.

Iâ€™m a member of the Technology team where I primarily contribute as part of the Data and AI Group. I also work on a number of other freelance projects, mostly in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems.

If you are interested in contacting me for any of support work I encourage you to contact via mail.

## Goals for 2022
Contribute to open source projects that I use. I want to contribute to all the main parts of my tech stack.
Travel more and visit friends I've made through support
